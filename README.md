# Threads---ExamPrep

The consumer thread wait 10 seconds for more numbers to consume, before terminating..

This could easily be changed to a more effective way where it simply terminates as soon as it has recieved a message
that no more numbers will be comming __BUT__

I only have 1 hour to finish the last assignment, so i will have to skip that for now hehe :P
